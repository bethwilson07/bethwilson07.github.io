	<h1>Hi there, I'm Beth Wilson!</h1>
	<p> A full stack web developer with a passion for social justice and entrepreneurship. With experience in Ruby on Rails,
JavaScript, React and Redux, and a background in secondary STEM education and non-profit work, I discovered web
    development through <a href="http://flatironschool.com" Flatiron School</a>â€™s Web Development Immersive class. I bring strong skills in team-building and project
management that help socially responsible companies invent and improve the technologies they create.</p>
