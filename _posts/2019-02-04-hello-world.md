Finally found a [blog](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to help me set up this website. 
It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts, which I'm still figuring out. 
This blog post is making it a lot easier than I thought it was going to be and I'm learning more about layouts!
Thanks, Jonathan!
